About
=====
Threadle is a high-performance software system for large, complex, multilayer network datasets, particularly from administrative registers.
Unlike general-purpose network libraries, it emphasizes memory-efficient storage and fast querying rather than implementing every graph algorithm.

Threadle is open source and built in .NET, with a Core module handling data models, processing, and file I/O for massive, multi-dimensional networks.
A fast CLI console provides direct use or interop from other languages, including R. Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, or it can be built from source.

Threadle can be compiled for multiple operating systems and architectures. See INSTALL.txt for information on how to compile Threadle from source.

Precompiled binaries and installation files for Windows, Linux, and MacOS are available on the project website:
