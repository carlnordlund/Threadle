To-do

Inventory: currently only returns a list. Perhaps better as json? And similar to info: either output as json for interop or list of lines for human readability.


threadleR stuff
===============

So: building an interop package for R!
In /threadleR/R/: threadle_client.R
Keep on adding functions and commenting - make sure they are up-to-date (new CLI command signatures)

Then to build package:
1. Navigate to inside /threadleR/ folder (i.e. where the stuff is)
2. library(roxygen2)
3. > roxygen2::roxygenise() # This will write NAMESPACE etc
4. Go to parent folder: /Threadle/Threadle.CLIconsole # i.e. the folder where /threadleR/ resides
5. > system("R CMD build threadleR") # This builds the tar.gz package
6. This package can now be installed: install.packages("threadleR_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
7. Then I can use it: library(threadleR)

Note that when starting: .start_threadle(), I really need to provide the path (assuming I am in \Threadle\Threadle.CLIconsole\)
path_to_exe <-"bin/Debug/net8.0/Threadle.CLIconsole.exe"
.start_threadle(path_to_exe)

Then I can later navigate etc and load networks etc.
